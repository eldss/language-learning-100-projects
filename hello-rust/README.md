# Hello World

Day 1 is a tiny Rust warm-up: compile and run the canonical "Hello, world" to make sure the toolchain is installed correctly.

## Requirements

- Rust toolchain with `cargo`

## Running

From the repo root run:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path hello-world/hello-rust/Cargo.toml
```

You should see `Hello, Rust! Welcome to day 1.` printed to stdout.
